The people that I've met through this club are the people that have shaped the person that I am today. Teaching the new members and learning from my peers encouraged me to seek a profession that would allow me to engage with people. I'm lucky to have been a member of this club and I love how much the community has grown since I joined in my freshman year. In my free time you'll usually see me ballroom dancing, watching kdramas, or playing Animal Crossing!",

Since I was drawn in by the pretty lights and joined Stuy Flow in my freshman year, I had the opportunity to meet unique people and truly find a family in the Stuyvesant community. I was able to step out of my comfort zone by performing on stage and by producing a show that I could be proud of. Having now graduated, I'm so proud of what Stuy Flow has since accomplished and how it's grown. In college, I was able to start a similar Flow club with other Stuy alums, and we hope to be able to introduce others to this new art form. I'm currently a marine science major and visual arts minor, so I enjoy drawing and photography in my free time. I also play badminton and figure skate, depending on the season! üôÇ",

Some of my other hobbies include bowling, programming, and eating in different restaurants around NYC!",
