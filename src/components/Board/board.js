I work as an employee for the Digital Humanities Lab at MIT, and I finish work every day by 5 PM at the latest. I don't smoke or drink, but I occasionally indulge myself with manga and anime. I'm in bed by 12 AM, and make sure I get six hours of sleep, no matter what. After drinking approximately 2.5 liters of room temperature water and doing about 5 pull-ups, 15 push-ups, and 20 squats, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness.",
