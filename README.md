## Instructions For Developers
1.) Clone the repository
```
git clone git@github.com:StuyFlow/StuyFlow.github.io.git
```
Make sure you have Python3!!!
Install flask by doing `pip3 install flask`.

2.) Make a new branch to start doing your changes:
```
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```
3.) If you want to save your changes to your branch:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Type message here. The quotes are necessary"
git push
```
NOTE: If you are pushing for the first time, do `git push -u origin <branch-name>`
instead to publish your branch first. Then you can use the above method for future changes.

4.) Once you are done making changes to your branch, make a pull request,
write what you changed, and request a review.

5.) The reviewer will make comments on the code and if everything is good, it will be merged to the master branch.
